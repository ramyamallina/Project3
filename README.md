Overview: In this project, I predicted the progression of Parkinson's disease by analyzing a dataset with information from over 5,000 patients. The objective is to forecast UPDRS scores, which indicate the severity of symptoms.

Data: "Parkinson's Disease Progression" dataset from Kaggle

Tools: I used Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.
For data visualization, I chose Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore and understand the data's distribution and the relationships between variables.
To build and refine the predictive model, I employed Sklearn, specifically its PolynomialFeatures for adding complexity to the model and LinearRegression for the prediction itself.

Highlights: My approach started with a basic linear regression model to establish a prediction baseline. As the project progressed, I explored more sophisticated modeling techniques, such as introducing polynomial features to capture the complexity of Parkinson's disease progression more accurately. This method significantly improved the model's predictive accuracy, offering promising insights for patient care and treatment planning.
